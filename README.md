OneDev parses source code to enable language aware code search and navigation. Currently supports Java, JavaScript, C, C++, CSharp, Go, PHP, Python, CSS, SCSS, LESS and R.

### Source and diff comment for code discussion and comprehension

![code discussion](https://onedev.io/img/features/code-comments.gif)

One can comment on selected regions of source or diff to start code discussions. Added comments will stay in context to help understanding code even if code is modified later.

### Rules to protect branches, tags, or files

![code protection](https://onedev.io/img/features/branch-protection.gif)

For changes affecting certain branches, tags or files, one can define rules to require specified builds or reviewers. These rules will be used as change acceptance gates in relevant pull requests.

### Intelligent commit query and subscription

![commit query](https://onedev.io/img/features/commit-query.gif)

Commit query can be easily constructed with a smart input box with auto suggestion and completion. Constructed query can be saved for quick access later, and saved query can be subscribed to get notifications of matching code changes.

### Advanced pull request for efficient code review

![pull request](https://onedev.io/img/features/advanced-pull-request.gif)

OneDev analyzes commits history to suggest most relevant reviewers for pull requests. It tracks review history so that reviewer only needs to examine changes since previous review. It also includes other productivity features such as rebase/squash tracking, merge preview, etc.

### Sophisticated pull request query and subscription

![pull request query](https://onedev.io/img/features/pull-request-query.gif)

Pull request query makes it easy to find interesting pull requests. For instance, you may list all pull requests requiring your review, or those reviewed by others and requiring your change. Queries can be saved for quick access later, and can be subscribed to get notifications of matching pull requests.

### Custom issue states and fields for flexible workflows

![issue customization](https://onedev.io/img/features/issue-customization.gif)

Issue states and fields are fully customizable. States can be configured to transit manually, or automatically when certain condition is satisfied. For instance you may configure the issue to change to "pending review" state when a pull request containing the fix is submitted, or "deployed" state when the build containing the fix is deployed.

### Powerful issue query and subscription

![issue query](https://onedev.io/img/features/issue-query.gif)

A query language is available to query and order issues based on different properties and their logical combinations. Issue query can be saved for quick access later, and saved query can be subscribed to get notification of matching issues

### Coherent and self-updating issue boards

![issue boards](https://onedev.io/img/features/issue-boards.gif)

Issue boards can be set up to show issues with different states or fields side by side. Upon issue modification, issue boards will be updated automatically to reflect most recent issue change.

### Cross references amongst code, issues and builds

![code issue and build cross reference](https://onedev.io/img/features/builds-issues-changes-cross-reference.gif)

Build information from Jenkins, TeamCity and QuickBuild can be fed into OneDev for cross references amongst code, issues and builds. For instance, you may list code changes and fixed issues between any two builds, or list all builds containing certain issue fix, etc.
